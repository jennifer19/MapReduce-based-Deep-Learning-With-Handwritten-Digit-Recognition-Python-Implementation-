#MapReduce-based Deep Learning With Handwritten Digit Recognition

Applied MapReduce idea into Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwriting Recognition by first getting temporary
corresponding weights matrix in Stochastic Gradient Descent and then combining all separate weights matrix to get
final model in CNN.


Use python multiprocessing library to runing two batch at differnt cpu at the same time.

You can refer the paper: MapReduce-based Deep Learning With Handwritten Digit Recognition Case Study to get more idea.
